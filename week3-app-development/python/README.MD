## 6. Connectivity to Cassandra 

Make sure you're in the right sub-directory (`javascript`) by issuing the following command in the GitPod terminal window.

```bash
cd /workspace/bootcamp-fullstack-apps-with-cassandra/week3-app-development/python
```

Verify again you're in the `python` sub-directory using the following command

```bash
pwd
```
**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```
/workspace/bootcamp-fullstack-apps-with-cassandra/week3-app-development/python
```

**‚úÖ Step 6a. Run unit test `Ex06_Connect_to_Astra.py`**

From the GitPod terminal window issue the following command

```bash
open connection.py
```

and notice the following lines have been updated with the appropriate values.


```javascript
// This is the "Client Id" value you obtained earlier
const USERNAME = "FXXXXXXXXXXl"; 
// This is the "Client Secret" value you obtained earlier
const PASSWORD = "FXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXdeOE.kio_.L981NQ.xq5HqXDB7s_FIJC.ssbLgbdz+G1IC0BCwIA_ZrwPrQNJWUiv26uZf2f4wo";
```

You can optionally issue the following command or notice the changes in the Gitpod explorer window. Hit space bar to proceed through the changes or hit <Ctrl-C> or `q` to exit the command.


```bash
git diff connection.py
```

You are ready and can now test the connection to Astra with the following command

```bash
python Ex06_Connect_to_Astra.py 
```
**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```
========================================
Start exercise
You are now connected to cluster cndb at us-east1
Success
========================================
```

## CRUD tests - TBD

You may run other Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) tests in the same sub-directory in a similar manner.
Periodically, verify from the CQL Shell in Gitpod that the programs/tests are working as expected.
