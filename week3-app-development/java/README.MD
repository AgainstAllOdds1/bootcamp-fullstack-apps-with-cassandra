## 6. Connectivity to Cassandra 

Make sure you're in the right sub-directory (`java`) by issuing the following command in the GitPod terminal window.

```bash
cd /workspace/bootcamp-fullstack-apps-with-cassandra/week3-app-development/java
```

Verify again you're in the `java` sub-directory using the following command

```bash
pwd
```
**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```
/workspace/bootcamp-fullstack-apps-with-cassandra/week3-app-development/java
```

**‚úÖ Step 6a. Run unit test `Ex06_Connect_to_Cassandra.java`**

From the GitPod terminal window issue the following command 

```bash
gp open src/main/java/com/datastax/workshop/DBConnection.java
```
and notice the following lines have been updated with the appropriate values.

```java
// This is the "Client Id" value you obtained earlier
String USERNAME = "FXXXXXXXXXXl";
// This is the "Client Secret" value you obtained earlier
String PASSWORD = "FXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXdeOE.kio_.L981NQ.xq5HqXDB7s_FIJC.ssbLgbdz+G1IC0BCwIA_ZrwPrQNJWUiv26uZf2f4w";
```

You can optionally issue the following command or notice the changes in the explorer window. 

```bash
git diff $_
```

Compile the project with the following command

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```

You are ready and can now test the connection to Astra with the following command

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=com.datastax.workshop.Ex06_Connect_to_Cassandra
```

## CRUD tests - TBD

You may run other Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) tests in the same sub-directory in a similar manner. Periodically, verify from the CQL Shell in Gitpod that the programs/tests are working as expected.
