![datamodel](images/AppDevSplash.png?raw=true)

Welcome to the 'App Dev of back end with Cassandra' workshop! In this two-hour workshop, the Developer Advocate team of DataStax presents the process and the basic tenets of backend App Dev. If you did not attend the previous workshops, please look at the previous weeks of the bootcamp 
[Week 1 - Intro to Cassandra](../week1-intro-to-cassandra) and [Week 2 - Data Modelling](../week2-data-modelling).

For the hands-on part of this workshop, we will use Astra DB, a Database-as-a-Service
built on Cassandra and delivered by DataStax, that was created as the data store for the Web application.

It doesn't matter if you join our workshop live or you prefer to do at your own pace, we have you covered. But please if you did not attend [Week 1 - Intro to Cassandra](../week1-intro-to-cassandra) and/or [Week 2 - Data Modelling](../week2-data-modelling) we suggest you get caught up since the material in this workshop will build on top of the previous weeks' workshops!

In this repository, you'll find everything you need for this workshop:
